## Market Validation Questions

Before building, validate with 10-15 Preston contractors:

1. How many subcontractors do you work with per project?
2. What's your average payment cycle to subcontractors?
3. How much time does CIS compliance take per month?
4. What tools do you currently use for subcontractor management?
5. What would reduce payment delays from 83 to 30 days be worth to you?
6. How do you currently track subcontractor performance?
7. What's your biggest frustration with current payment processes?
8. Would you pay £300-500/month for automated compliance + faster payments?
