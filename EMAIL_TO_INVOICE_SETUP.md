# Email-to-Invoice Setup Guide

## ✅ What I Just Built

Your SiteSense app now has **automatic email-to-invoice processing**!

**How it works:**
```
Subcontractor emails invoice@yourcompany.com (PDF attached)
     ↓
SendGrid receives email → Sends to your webhook
     ↓
SiteSense extracts PDF → Runs AI OCR → Creates invoice
     ↓
You get email notification: "New invoice: INV-123 - £1,500 (Low risk, auto-approved)"
     ↓
Done! Invoice is in your dashboard ready for payment run
```

## 🚀 Setup Instructions (15 minutes)

### Step 1: Create SendGrid Account (5 min) - FREE

1. Go to: https://signup.sendgrid.com/
2. Click "Start for free"
3. Fill in details:
   - Email: your email
   - Password: create one
   - Click "Create Account"
4. Verify your email (check inbox)
5. Skip onboarding wizard (click "Skip" or close it)

---

### Step 2: Get Your Webhook URL (1 min)

Your webhook URL is:
```
https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/email-invoice
```

**For testing locally (with ngrok):**
```bash
# Install ngrok (if you don't have it)
brew install ngrok  # Mac
# or download from: https://ngrok.com/download

# Start ngrok tunnel
ngrok http 3000

# Copy the HTTPS URL (e.g., https://abc123.ngrok.io)
# Your webhook URL is: https://abc123.ngrok.io/api/webhooks/email-invoice
```

**For production (after deploying to Vercel):**
```
https://sitesense.vercel.app/api/webhooks/email-invoice
```

---

### Step 3: Configure SendGrid Inbound Parse (5 min)

1. Log into SendGrid: https://app.sendgrid.com/
2. Go to **Settings** → **Inbound Parse** (left sidebar)
   - Direct link: https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/parse
3. Click **"Add Host & URL"** button

4. Fill in the form:
   - **Domain:** Choose one of these options:

   **Option A: Use SendGrid's domain (easiest, no DNS setup)**
   ```
   Domain: parse.sendgrid.net
   Subdomain: your-company-name-123  (make it unique)

   Result: your-company-name-123@parse.sendgrid.net
   ```

   **Option B: Use your own domain (requires DNS)**
   ```
   Domain: yourdomain.com
   Subdomain: invoices

   Result: invoices@yourdomain.com
   ```

   - **Destination URL:** Your webhook URL from Step 2
     ```
     https://abc123.ngrok.io/api/webhooks/email-invoice
     ```

   - **Check spam check:** YES
   - **POST the raw, full MIME message:** NO (leave unchecked)

5. Click **"Add"**

---

### Step 4: DNS Setup (ONLY if using your own domain)

**Skip this if using parse.sendgrid.net!**

If you chose Option B (your own domain), you need to add DNS records:

1. SendGrid will show you an MX record like:
   ```
   Type: MX
   Host: invoices (or invoices.yourdomain.com)
   Value: mx.sendgrid.net
   Priority: 10
   ```

2. Go to your DNS provider (Cloudflare, GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)
3. Add the MX record exactly as shown
4. Wait 5-60 minutes for DNS to propagate
5. Test by sending email to `invoices@yourdomain.com`

---

### Step 5: Test the Integration (4 min)

1. **Make sure your dev server is running:**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. **If testing locally, start ngrok:**
   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000
   ```

3. **Add a test subcontractor in SiteSense:**
   - Go to: http://localhost:3000/dashboard/subcontractors/new
   - Add a subcontractor with **your email address** as the contact email
   - Example:
     - Company: Test Electrical Ltd
     - Email: **youremail@gmail.com** (use YOUR real email)
     - UTR: 1234567890
     - CIS Status: STANDARD (20%)
   - Save

4. **Email a test invoice:**
   - From: **youremail@gmail.com** (same email you used for subcontractor)
   - To: **your-company-name-123@parse.sendgrid.net** (the email you set up)
   - Subject: Test Invoice
   - Attachment: **Any PDF file** (can be a real invoice or just any PDF for testing)
   - Send!

5. **Check results (within 30 seconds):**
   - Check your email inbox → Should receive: "New Invoice: INV-XXX - £X (Low/Medium/High risk)"
   - Go to: http://localhost:3000/dashboard/invoices
   - Should see the new invoice!

## 🎯 How to Use (Daily Workflow)

### For Your Subcontractors:

**Send them this email:**
```
Hi [Subcontractor Name],

Good news! You can now send invoices directly via email.

Just email your invoices (PDF attachment) to:
invoices@yourcompany.com

We'll process them automatically and you'll get paid faster.

Thanks!
[Your Name]
```

### For You (Finance Manager):

**Every morning:**
1. Check email for notifications: "New invoice: INV-123 - £1,500"
2. Open dashboard: http://localhost:3000/dashboard/invoices
3. Review any medium/high-risk invoices (low-risk are auto-approved)
4. Done! Invoices are ready for payment run on Friday

**Time saved:** 10-15 minutes per invoice → 2 minutes per invoice

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Subcontractor not found for email"

**Problem:** The sender's email doesn't match any subcontractor in your database.

**Solution:**
1. Make sure the subcontractor's email in SiteSense matches the "From" address
2. Email matching is case-insensitive and extracts from "Name <email@example.com>" format
3. If subcontractor uses multiple emails, add them first or update their profile

---

### Issue: "No PDF attachment found"

**Problem:** Email doesn't have a PDF attachment or it's not recognized.

**Solution:**
1. Make sure the attachment is actually a PDF (not a Word doc or image)
2. Attachment must have `.pdf` extension
3. Try renaming the file to end with `.pdf`

---

### Issue: Email webhook not receiving emails

**Problem:** SendGrid not sending to your webhook.

**Check:**
1. Verify webhook URL is correct in SendGrid Inbound Parse settings
2. If using ngrok, make sure ngrok is still running (it times out after 2 hours on free tier)
3. Check SendGrid activity log: https://app.sendgrid.com/email_activity
4. Test webhook manually:
   ```bash
   curl https://your-webhook-url/api/webhooks/email-invoice
   # Should return: {"status":"ok","endpoint":"email-invoice-webhook"}
   ```

---

### Issue: AI analysis fails

**Problem:** "Failed to analyze invoice"

**Check:**
1. Make sure `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set in `.env.local`
2. Check API key is valid: https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys
3. Check Anthropic usage limits (free tier: $5/month credit)
4. Check PDF is not corrupted or password-protected

---

### Issue: No notification email received

**Problem:** Invoice created but you didn't get notified.

**Check:**
1. Make sure `RESEND_API_KEY` is set in `.env.local`
2. Check spam folder
3. Verify admin user email is correct in database
4. Check Resend dashboard: https://resend.com/emails

---

## 🎨 Customization Options

### Change Auto-Approve Thresholds

Edit `/src/app/api/webhooks/email-invoice/route.ts` (line 131):

```typescript
// Current: Auto-approve if risk < 30 AND trusted AND amount < £5,000
if (aiResult.riskScore < 30 &&
    subcontractor.totalInvoices && subcontractor.totalInvoices > 10 &&
    aiResult.totalAmount < 5000) {
  initialStatus = 'APPROVED';
}

// More aggressive (auto-approve more):
if (aiResult.riskScore < 50 &&
    subcontractor.totalInvoices && subcontractor.totalInvoices > 5 &&
    aiResult.totalAmount < 10000) {
  initialStatus = 'APPROVED';
}

// More conservative (approve less):
if (aiResult.riskScore < 20 &&
    subcontractor.totalInvoices && subcontractor.totalInvoices > 20 &&
    aiResult.totalAmount < 2000) {
  initialStatus = 'APPROVED';
}
```

---

### Change Notification Email Template

Edit `/src/app/api/webhooks/email-invoice/route.ts` (line 156):

```typescript
await sendEmailNotification({
  to: adminEmail,
  subject: `[CUSTOM] New Invoice: ${invoice.invoiceNumber}`,
  text: `Your custom template here...`,
});
```

---

### Add Multiple Recipients

```typescript
// Send to multiple people
for (const email of ['finance@company.com', 'admin@company.com']) {
  await sendEmailNotification({
    to: email,
    subject: `New Invoice: ${invoice.invoiceNumber}`,
    text: `...`,
  });
}
```

## 💰 Cost Breakdown

### SendGrid Free Tier:
- **100 emails/day** (inbound)
- **100 emails/day** (outbound for notifications)
- Total: **FREE** for up to 100 invoices/day

### If you exceed free tier:
- **Essentials Plan:** £15/month for 50,000 emails
- You'd need to process **1,600+ invoices/day** to need this

### Anthropic AI (OCR):
- **Claude Haiku:** £0.25/1M input tokens, £1.25/1M output tokens
- Average invoice: ~5,000 tokens input + 500 tokens output = **£0.002/invoice**
- 100 invoices/day × 30 days = £6/month

**Total monthly cost: £0-6/month** (for typical SME usage)
