## Troubleshooting

### Email Not Received?

**Check 1: Resend API Key**
```bash
# In .env.local, make sure you have:
RESEND_API_KEY="re_your_actual_key"
```

**Check 2: Check Server Logs**
```bash
# Look for:
"Welcome email sent successfully: <message-id>"
# Or error:
"Failed to send welcome email: <error>"
```

**Check 3: Spam Folder**
- Check your spam/junk folder
- Resend emails can sometimes land there on first send

**Check 4: Resend Dashboard**
1. Go to https://resend.com/emails
2. Check recent emails
3. See delivery status

### Database Connection Issues?

```bash
# Test connection
nc -zv caboose.proxy.rlwy.net 55039

# Should see: "Connection succeeded!"

# If it fails, Railway might be sleeping. Try:
npx prisma db push
# This will wake it up
```

### Port Already in Use?

```bash
# Kill process on port 3000
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9

# Restart
pnpm dev
```
